    <string name="game_description">This game is about the user has to find all the missing airplane behind those card./n/n
        When the user clicked once, if there is an airplane under that field, the airplane will be displayed. However, if there has no
        airplane, there will display a hint number that tell you how many airplane are there in the same row and same column in the
        field that the user have clicked.\n\nBesides, after the airplane has displayed, you can clicked once again to display the
        hint number.\n\nHowever, this game is to aim for using the fewest scan to finish the game. Good Luck!</string>
